I am **Eleanor (Shengfang) Song**, a Ph.D. candidate in **Biostatistics** at *Michigan State University*. My research focuses on **causal inference using large-scale longitudinal survey data**, with particular emphasis on developing and applying **stochastic intervention frameworks** that account for **continuous exposures**, **nonresponse bias**, and **missing-data mechanisms**.

With over **five years of experience** analyzing complex **epidemiological and social survey data**, I have contributed to multiple interdisciplinary projects investigating environmental and social determinants of health outcomes, including **pesticide exposure**, **olfactory impairment**, and **Parkinson’s disease**. My work combines rigorous statistical modeling—such as **mixed-effects models**, **joint models**, and **machine learning–based estimation**—with applied insights from population health research.

Before pursuing my Ph.D., I worked as a **clinical researcher and ophthalmic technician** at *Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center*, where I conducted pediatric eye health studies and developed screening strategies for early detection of visual disorders. This hands-on clinical and research experience continues to inform my approach to data quality, measurement, and study design.

I am passionate about leveraging quantitative methods to address real-world public health questions and improving inference from complex observational data. My long-term goal is to integrate **advanced causal modeling** and **data science techniques** to produce robust, interpretable evidence that informs policy and public health practice.
