## Research Experience

### Research Assistant, Michigan State University *(01/2020–Present)*

*The Long-term Causal Effect of Pesticide Exposure on Olfactory Impairment (Ph.D. Dissertation, 2024–Present)*
- Leveraging data from the U.S. Agricultural Health Study (AHS)—an ongoing long-term prospective cohort of over 52,000 licensed farmers followed across multiple phases over 30 years with comprehensive longitudinal pesticide exposure assessments—and its sub-cohort, the Pesticide and the Sense of Smell (PASS) study, a stratified subsample of Phase 4 participants selected using predefined sampling weights.
- Co-designed the study in collaboration with faculty mentors, focusing on exposure and outcome measurement and contributing to the sampling design for the PASS sub-cohort.
- Conducted data cleaning and management for large, complex epidemiological datasets, ensuring high-quality longitudinal data for analysis.
- Applying causal inference methods using a stochastic intervention framework incorporating missing-data mechanisms, accounting for continuous exposures, complex sampling, and nonresponse bias.

*High Pesticide Exposure Events and Olfactory Impairment (2023–Present)*
- Investigated the association between high pesticide exposure events (HPEEs) and olfactory impairment (OI) among older farmers using large-scale longitudinal survey data from the AHS.
- Co-designed the study in collaboration with faculty mentors, conducted data cleaning and management.
- Applied inverse probability of censoring weighted target maximum likelihood estimation (IPCW-TMLE) to estimate marginal effects, accounting for complex sampling design, nonresponse, and multiple covariates.
- Implemented supervised learning with 10-fold cross-validation, combining baseline, regularized, and advanced machine learning models to capture complex exposure-response patterns while minimizing overfitting.
- First-authored manuscript under review.
- This study was supported by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), and in part by the Intramural Research Programs of National Institutes of Health (NIH), NIEHS, and the National Cancer Institute (NCI).

- Evaluated the association between self-reported motor and nonmotor symptoms and prodromal probability of Parkinson’s disease (PD) with incident PD among U.S. farmers using large-scale longitudinal survey data from the AHS.
- Co-designed the study in collaboration with faculty mentors, conducted data cleaning and management
- Coordinated PD case adjudication, integrating self-reports, proxy reports, medical records, physician confirmations, and death certificate records to validate diagnoses.
